This project won 3rd place in HSHACKS25!

The theme for this hackathon was educating others, so I created a prodigy/pokemon inspired quiz game!
The game is played by deafeting and capturing monsters, and the players moves will only work if they are able to answer the questions correctly.
Any questions can be put into the question set, making this game work for those who want a good way to study for there final exams.
